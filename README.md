This Code Base is Part of my Master Thesis in Mathematics. The main gaol was to write HPC for Option PRicing and stochastic model calibration in real time to market Data. The numerical approach was to use a PDE based approach for Option pricing and the Leveneberg Marquart algorithm for the calibration. 

A good start to understand the theory behind this code base is my Reddit Post:

For the Performance Benchmarks see the following:
